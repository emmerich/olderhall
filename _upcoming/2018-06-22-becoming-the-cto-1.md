title: Becoming the CTO Part 1 - What is a CTO ?
---

One of the biggest challenges I've faced over the past 2 years is the transition from a developer at Wuha to the CTO.

It's a challenge to move from a very technical role that you understand well to a higher-level, human one. The "technical" in CTO is also a trap. It tricks new leaders into staying too low-level and technical.

In this series of posts I'll try to explain what I've come to understand from the role of CTO, the responsibilities of the role and, more importantly, how you can transition into that position whilst still staying close to what inspired you to work in tech.

# What is a CTO ?

I want to start this series by actually defining what a CTO is. There isn't one answer, and they aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, you might find that you perform part of each role simultaneously.

The answer isn't always constant either. You may find that as a business grows and its needs evolve, the role changes.

Instead, I'll go through the CTO "personas" that I've encountered. These are the common characteristics I find when meeting CTOs and discussing the role. Of course they're massively simplified, but I hope to give an overview of the different traits I've seen.

## The Visionary

Examples:
* @Colin Eberhardt at Scott Logic
*
*

What are upcoming technologies and how do they change the business?
What are your company's strategies for innovation and bringing on new concepts?

These are questions that the visionary can answer. This role remains fairly technical - if the question is "should we be interesting Web Assembly?", I'd expect the visionary to dig into the code, write some demo applications, and really understand its viability.

I've found that the visionary is a role very similar to sales. New technologies are difficult to explain - startups are built and fall on their ability to explain (and sell) something new to people. A visionary who can not only discover new technologies but also sell them (whether it's internally or to clients) will be able to influence the technical direction of the company.

I learnt a lot working with Colin at Scott Logic because he was not only able to technically explain new technology, but he was often on the frontlines pushing it to clients and internally.


## The Teacher

Examples:
*
*
*

The teacher is an engineer with great leadership and teaching skills. The teacher becomes the technical authority internally - the person that you can ask any question.

This is a dangerous role to fill. You **need** at least one teachers in the business, but it doesn't need to be the CTO - and it often clashes with other roles.

The teacher is an inward-facing role. They need to be available, close to the code, and approachable. If the CTO has a more outward-facing role, it'd be difficult to perform both.

TODO: rewrite this paragraph
When I become CTO of Wuha, I took into account that as a non-native French speaker it would be difficult for me to explain complex concepts to others without one of us speaking a non-native language. Communication with other developers is paramount for the teacher, and we were also lucky to have some very knowledgable developers, so I elected the others as authorities.

## The Evangelist

Examples:
*
*
*

The evangelist is the technical face of the company. Talks, conferences, blog posts, technical articles - the evangelist makes sure that the world knows what the company is doing technically.

I believe this is a massively underrated part of the CTO's job **especially** at startups. It's also probably the less technical and, for someone coming from an engineering role, the hardest to adjust to. I think one of the problems is that people will often assume that the voice and image of the company should be controlled by marketing - but I disagree, especially for tech companies.

Being an evangelist means being comfortable talking in public, answering difficult questions and in all honesty knowing how to bullshit a little bit.


## The Machine

Examples:
* Linus Torvalds

The machine will churn out code, new features, fix bugs, and generally work non-stop. I generally advise against this type of CTO. It usually happens in one of the following situations:
* the CTO doesn't really know how to adapt to the role and just ends up working more
* an engineer who already works a lot is promoted to a CTO role because it seems the logical next step

I've found that CTO is not a linear step up from developer. It just doesn't seem to work - and it can often have a negative effect on the team.

I'm not saying that CTOs should not work a lot, and I'm not saying that engineers need to work a lot if they are looking to move to a CTO role. Scaling by simply putting in more hours is not an effective use of time for a CTO.

Having said that, every company that exists today will undergo crunch. It's not a healthy way to work but it's unavoidable.

#Â Role Clash

Lead Developer clashes with technical leader (if leadership material)
VP of Engineering clashes with visionary
CEO can clash with evangelist
