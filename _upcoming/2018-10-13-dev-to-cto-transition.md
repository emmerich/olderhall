title: Exercises for transitioning from Developer to CTO
---

In my professional career I've worked with and talked to a lot of different types of CTO. Given that the majority of businesses involve some sort of technical aspect, the role is necessary almost everywhere.

One common career path is the "developer-turned-CTO". These are technical people, usually in startups, who take on more responsibility either by choice or by default.

I think engineers make great CTOs, but they'll often change title and keep the same daily work. As I made the same transition at Wuha, I wanted to write about some pointers people can follow to successfully migrate to the role.

I'll preface this by saying that the role of CTO changes depending on the company. If you like, this article could be seen as tips on how to move into a more management / strategic role - of which CTO is one - if you're coming from a technical background.

# Information Granularity - know everything and know why

Let's talk about the granularity of information necessary at the CTO level. You need to know:

* What your company is doing
* What each of your direct reports (usually developers or people more technical than you) are doing
* What your company is going to do

You do **not** need to know:

* Every line of code
* Every pull request
* Every bug that is found in the product

Learn to move conversations away from things that are too technical. There is an exception to this rule: when you know what you're talking about. You'll find that at the very beginning you'll be involved in a lot of low-level technical conversations. This is normal because you're transitioning into a new role.

Exercises:
* Talk to each of your direct reports your company one time per week and just say "how that X coming along?"
* Point-blank refuse to talk code with your team

# Ask simple questions

# Be a decision maker

Technical people love to discuss. We think of all the possibilities, the impact of all those possibilities, which is the easier to code, which has the fewest dependencies. You, as the CTO, need to rarely give input in these conversations besides asking good questions.

However, you need to be there to make the decision. Unless the decision is obvious (because everyone is agreed), you are always going to be someone's bad guy. This is normal, making decisions is hard when not everyone agrees.

You should also not to be afraid to make mistakes. When we learn, we make mistakes. What you should learn to do is identify decisions where you're not sure.

Don't get sucked into technical debates and step away from the code.

Make sure people know why you're making the decision.

# Pitch, sell, network. You are an outward-facing resource - show your passion
* Be able to pitch, sell, and network. (link the Sam Altman tweet). Hack it, treat it like a technical problem.
* Be passionate about tech, but don't try to show off. You are the technical image of your company.

# Practice your communication
* You need to be able to talk to non-technical people about tech, and to technical people about non-tech. Choose the right level for the conversation.


Miles may vary:
* What if this isn't enough - you're not a CTO, you're a dev
* Don't lose your passion
* Dress like a manager
* Speak less
* When you code, be an example.
* Let your team help you.
